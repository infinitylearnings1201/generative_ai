Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",

Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.
